# Maintenance Management System

## Application Definition Statement

The Maintenance Management System is a web-based application designed to help businesses efficiently manage maintenance tasks, track asset status, and automate preventive maintenance schedules. This system streamlines communication between maintenance teams and administrators, ensuring that work orders, resources, and task statuses are organized and accessible in real time.

## Target Market

_Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices._

_Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles._

[ Replace this text with a description of any Primary and Secondary research you conducted to determine the Target Market for your application. Link to any references used during this research. ]

## User Profile / Persona

_User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market._

[ Replace this text with a User Profile / Persona for your application. If necessary, research 'Web User Persona' to generate ideas. ]

## Use Cases

_A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used._

_Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing._

[ Describe two or more Use Cases for your application. Use a bulleted list to describe the steps involved in each Use Case. ]
