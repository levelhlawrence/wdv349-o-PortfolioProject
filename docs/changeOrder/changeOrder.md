# Change Order

## Scope

The Proposal and Tech Stack documents summarize the current project scope accurately. However, the following adjustments and clarifications are proposed to enhance alignment with real-world CMMS expectations and insights gathered from additional research.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack overall remains the same. The only major change is the backend which was switch to Python Django and is now changed to NodeJS, Express, and TypeScript.

- **Backend:** [NodeJS/TypeScript](https://blog.logrocket.com/express-typescript-node/)
- **Frontend:** [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn)

## Proposed Changes to Project Scope

Scope Refinement: In addition to school buses, maintenance support will now explicitly include company vehicles and police cars for school districts.

<hr >
Mobile Optimization Priority: Given the feedback from interviews, extra emphasis will be placed on building responsive mobile features for field technicians.
<hr >
Enhanced Reporting Features: Introduce visual dashboard elements (charts, KPIs) to provide quick summaries for maintenance trends, upcoming tasks, and parts inventory.
<hr >
Modular Asset Categories: Assets will now be grouped by type (Bus, Van, Car, Other) to simplify search and reporting features.
<hr >

## Research (Update)

Some of the research done to get a solid understanding of modern maintenance systems and best practices for digital transformation centered around CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems).

### Key Takeaways

- **CMMS Purpose:** A CMMS is designed to manage and centralize maintenance data, streamline operations, reduce downtime, and increase asset lifespan. Itâ€™s particularly useful across industries such as manufacturing, transportation, power generation, and logistics.

- **Benefits:**

  - Reduced maintenance and inventory costs
  - Enhanced tracking of work orders and assets
  - Preventive maintenance scheduling
  - Centralized data access (including mobile)
  - Improved communication across teams
  - Increased user accountability and productivity

- **Implementation Goals:**

  - Standardize internal operations
  - Increase team-wide adoption
  - Drive digital transformation
  - Improve transparency and decision-making through metrics and reporting

- **Best Practices for CMMS Integration:**
  1. Involve the entire team early in the transition process
  1. Clearly outline business goals, key features, and KPIs
  1. Select functionality that aligns with operational needs (e.g., asset tracking, stock management, role-based access)
  1. Plan for full adoption to ensure consistent data entry and accountability
  1. Prepare for change and address resistance with clarity and training
  1. Use data-driven dashboards to support continuous improvement
