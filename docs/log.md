## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This past week, I focused on updating log files in the project repository and improving my time management skills to stay on track. I also worked on understanding how to jump between branches and use GitHub workflows more effectively, including creating and merging branches. As well as keeping track of my progress using Milestones #.

🌵 Challenges - I struggled with figuring out how to manage multiple branches without causing conflicts. I also was a bit rocking with the time management aspect of things.

🏆 Accomplishments - I improved my proficiency with GitHub by successfully managing feature branches and improving my workflow efficiency. I also gained some new skills in organizing and maintaining detailed log files for better project tracking.

🔮 Next Steps - Next, I plan to focus on conducting more research into effective application design strategies and begin working on the design and layout for the Maintenance Management System.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - I focused on design research and wireframing for the Maintenance Management System this week. I explored different design principles and tools to create effective and user-friendly layouts.

🌵 Challenges - I couldn’t get the final design to my liking, and it took longer than expected to settle on a direction. I still gained valuable insights along the way.

🏆 Accomplishments - I made significant progress in wireframing and established a solid foundation for the application design. While it’s not finalized, I’m happy with how it’s progressing and the skills I’m developing.

🔮 Next Steps - I plan to iterate on the wireframes, finalize the design, and begin implementing the layout in code. I will also continue researching best practices for maintaining consistent design elements.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview - This week, I focused on design and best UI/UX practices, creating a basic frontend and developing a working prototype. I prioritized user-friendly features and ensured the design followed modern standards while remaining functional.

🌵 Challenges - Time management remained a significant challenge as I balanced design, coding, and researching potential use cases. The broad scope of possibilities often made it difficult to stay focused, but I addressed this by narrowing my research and breaking tasks into manageable sections.

🏆 Accomplishments - I successfully implemented a functional prototype while improving my understanding of UI/UX principles. Translating design concepts into a working interface felt like a major step forward.

🔮 Next Steps - I plan to refine the frontend further, enhancing its design and usability. Once the frontend reaches a satisfactory level, I’ll begin building a basic backend using Django, focusing on establishing essential database connections and backend logic to support the prototype’s functionality.
