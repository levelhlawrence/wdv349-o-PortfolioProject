## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This past week, I focused on updating log files in the project repository and improving my time management skills to stay on track. I also worked on understanding how to jump between branches and use GitHub workflows more effectively, including creating and merging branches. As well as keeping track of my progress using Milestones #.

<br>
🌵 Challenges - I struggled with figuring out how to manage multiple branches without causing conflicts. I also was a bit rocking with the time management aspect of things.

<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I improved my proficiency with GitHub by successfully managing feature branches and improving my workflow efficiency. I also gained some new skills in organizing and maintaining detailed log files for better project tracking.

<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next, I plan to focus on conducting more research into effective application design strategies and begin working on the design and layout for the Maintenance Management System.
