**FleetCarePro Weekly Status Report**  
**Prepared by:** Level Lawrence
**Date:** 05/11/2025

**Last Week’s Progress:**  
This past week, I focused on developing FleetCarePro’s marketing strategy and SEO optimization, including keyword research and metadata planning to target school districts and government fleets. I also built the core framework for the fleet management dashboard UI. Due to personal commitments (my wedding), I faced time constraints but mitigated this by consulting a friend who works in HR for marketing insights and using tools like Google Analytics and HubSpot tutorials to refine my approach. Despite challenges, I successfully broke tasks into manageable steps and completed 80% of the marketing groundwork ahead of schedule.

**Current Work:**  
I am now actively working on two parallel tracks:

1. **Academic Assignments:** Prioritizing and completing all pending coursework early this week (Monday-Wednesday) to free up development time.
2. **FleetCarePro Development:** Developing FleetCarePro's work order management system and user authentication features. I'm building a React frontend for creating and tracking work orders with form validation for different maintenance types and priority levels. On the backend, I'm implementing Express.js API routes to handle work order creation and status updates. For security, I'm adding JWT authentication with password hashing and protected routes to restrict unauthorized access.

**Next Week’s Plan:**  
Once assignments are cleared, I will dedicate full focus to FleetCarePro’s beta milestones:

- Finalize the work order system’s API and frontend functionality.
- Implement task tracking and notes.
- Add some basic auth and route protection.
- Refine SEO based on performance data.

**Project Status:**

- **Timeline:** Slightly behind due to delays but recoverable with focused effort.
- **Successes:** Marketing/SEO framework is 80% complete; work order backend is 10% implemented.
- **Challenges:** Localhost GA4 session tracking requires minor fixes; API integration is slower than anticipated.
- **Contingency:** If delays persist, I'll reevaluate the project scope and adjust accordingly.
