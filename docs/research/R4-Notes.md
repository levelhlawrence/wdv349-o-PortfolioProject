## Front-End Development üñ•Ô∏è

This file covers notes related to front-end development, React, styling techniques, code quality practices, and deployment strategies.

## React Best Practices üìù

- **Thinking in React**:
  - Breaking down a design into logical components ensures modularity and reusability. React's guide emphasizes a step-by-step approach to identifying UI hierarchy and managing state effectively.
- **File Structure in React**: 
  - Proper organization of files simplifies scalability and maintenance. The resource outlines folder structures to categorize components, assets, and styles effectively.
- **PropTypes & Default Props**:
  - Using PropTypes improves components by validating props, and Default Props ensure fallback values are provided, reducing potential errors.

## Styling Techniques in React üé®

- **Why ModuleCSS**:
  - CSS modules enable scoped styling, preventing class name conflicts.
  - TailwindCSS, a utility-first framework, enables rapid styling through pre-defined classes. 

## Code Quality and Deployment üëî

- **Why ESLint**: 
  - Ensures code cleanliness by identifying syntax issues and enforcing coding standards. This tool helps catch potential bugs early and maintain team-wide consistency.
- **Deployment Using Heroku**:
  - Heroku's step-by-step deployment guide simplifies deploying Django applications. It supports seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment, allowing projects to be easily pushed and updated. By using the GitHub Student Developer Pack, students can access free platform credits, making Heroku an excellent choice for hosting Django projects in both staging and production environments.
