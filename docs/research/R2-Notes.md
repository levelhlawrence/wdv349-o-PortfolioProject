## Maintenance Management App Design Process

This document contains general notes related to the research and design considerations for developing a maintenance management application.
<br>

## User Needs and Pain Points

- Maintenance teams need real-time tracking of tasks and asset status.

- Users prefer a mobile-friendly interface for field access.

- Simplified reporting features can significantly improve efficiency.

<br>

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js and MongoDB offer scalability and efficiency for backend development.

- MongoDB provides flexible schema design for handling diverse datasets.

- Authentication and role-based access control are critical for security (most likely Passport or OAuth).

<br>

## Competitor Analysis

- Existing apps often lack customization options for specific industries.

- Competitor tools focus heavily on scheduling but less on analytics.

- Integration with IoT devices is becoming a competitive advantage (Likely out of scope).
