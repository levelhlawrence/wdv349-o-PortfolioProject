# Project & Portfolio

- **Research Notes - Milestone 3**
- **Level Lawrence**
- **Assignment Due Date: December 16, 2024**

## Basic Backend and Database Connections

This is the third research doc for my maintenance management application. This covers some key points taken from the Law of UX as well as finalization of what I will be using as a backend for this assign. Yes it will be in Python!

### Backend Implementation

- The backend implementation has been updated to use Python with **Django** instead of Node.js. Django is chosen for its robust framework, built-in ORM (object relational mapper), and ease of integration with PostgreSQL.
- Django REST Framework simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs.
- Middleware in Django, such as authentication and request/response handling, streamlines backend processes.

### Database Connections

- PostgreSQL is a reliable and scalable choice for managing relational data. Just to get something up and running I'll use SQLlite to start with.
- Django integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL, SQLlite, as well as MongoBD through its built-in ORM and migration tools.

### Research Notes for Project Direction

- Version control with Git/GitHub ensures project milestones are tracked and shared effectively.
- Documenting API endpoints with tools like Swagger or Postman improves collaboration and usability.
- React.js provides a dynamic frontend for maintaining state and enhancing user interaction. Also may use React Native for mobile integration (out of scope).

### Research on Progressive Web Applications (PWA) for Maintenance Management App

- PWAs offer offline functionality through service workers and local caching.
- Responsive design in PWAs ensures compatibility across devices.
- Features like push notifications and home screen installation enhance user engagement.

## Research on Laws of UX for Application Design

- **Hick’s Law:** Simplify choices to reduce decision-making time.
- **Fitts’s Law:** Ensure interactive elements are easily clickable with appropriate sizing and spacing.
- **Jakob’s Law:** Maintain consistency with familiar design patterns to meet user expectations.
- **Law of Proximity:** Group related elements together to improve visual clarity.
- **Cognitive Load:** Minimize unnecessary information to reduce the mental effort required from users.
- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect:** Focus on clean, visually appealing design to improve perceived usability.
