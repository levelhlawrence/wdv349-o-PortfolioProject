## Mechanic User Story (Research)

### Task Clock-In

Mechanics can select an assigned task and initiate a timer to accurately record the time spent on each job. This functionality allows them to pause or stop the timer as necessary, with the system logging the total time worked. Accurate time tracking is essential for labor cost analysis and productivity assessment.

### Completion Notes

Upon completing a task, mechanics can enter detailed notes describing the work performed. The system supports text input. Additionally, the capability to attach relevant documents or images to the task is crucial for comprehensive documentation and future reference.

### Creating New Tasks

If additional issues are identified during a job, mechanics can create a new task within the system. This new task includes fields for a detailed description, priority level, and options to attach relevant photos or documents. They can assign the task to themselves or notify the appropriate personnel for assignment, ensuring that all issues are addressed promptly.

### Work Order Overview

Mechanics have access to a comprehensive list of their assigned work orders, each displaying status indicators such as pending, in progress, or completed. The system provides filters to sort tasks by priority, due date, or equipment type, allowing them to manage their workload effectively. Notifications for new assignments or updates to existing work orders ensure they stay informed and responsive.

### Mobile Accessibility

The maintenance management system is accessible via mobile devices, enabling mechanics to manage tasks while on the move. Offline functionality ensures they can continue working in areas with limited connectivity, with data syncing once reconnected. The ability to scan equipment barcodes or QR codes to quickly access related work orders and asset information enhances efficiency and accuracy in the field.
