# 3.3 Compliance & Security

**Author:** Level Lawrence  
**Assignment:** 3.3 Compliance & Security  
**Date:** April 26, 2025

## üìú Proposal Reflection

For my **FleetCare Pro** application I focused on improving maintenance management for fleets by centralizing maintenance records, scheduling tasks, and reducing operational downtime.

After reviewing compliance and security considerations this week, I realize that protecting sensitive maintenance data (such as building layouts, client information, or service history) is critical to gaining client trust and ensuring long-term success.

As a result, I will implement the following compliance and security strategies:

- Introduce a **Terms of Service** outlining user rights, responsibilities, and legal disclaimers.
- Add a **Privacy Policy** that explains how maintenance and personal data are collected, stored, and shared.
- Offer **open data export** options (CSV, JSON) to empower users to control their data, aligning with principles advocated by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
