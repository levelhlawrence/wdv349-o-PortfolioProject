# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work?

## Application Design

I plan to use Figma for the design of the application. Figma provides a great interface for creating interactive prototypes, allowing me to refine the user experience before development. I will also be using Material-UI for UI components.

## Front End Framework

I will use React for the front-end development. React's component-based structure allows me to build in a scalable way. I plan to use TailwindCSS for styling. ESLint style guide to maintain code consistency and I may also use TypeScript (TBD).

## State Management

I will use React's useContext and Context API for state management. This provides a lightweight and efficient solution for managing global state without the complexity of Redux. The Context API is particularly useful for this project as it simplifies the state-sharing process across components while maintaining clear and manageable code.

## Node

I do not plan to use Node.js in this project, as the back-end API will be built using Django REST Framework. Django provides a robust and efficient framework for back-end development, eliminating the need for a Node.js setup.

## Express

Instead of Express, I will use Django REST Framework (DRF) to handle the API layer. DRF offers built-in functionality for creating RESTful APIs, including serialization, authentication, and routing, making it an excellent alternative to Express.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

I plan to use PostgreSQL as the relational database solution for this project. Django's built-in ORM will replace Sequelize to handle migrations, models, and seeding. The Django ORM provides a seamless way to interact with PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient CRUD operations, validation, and relational model management.
