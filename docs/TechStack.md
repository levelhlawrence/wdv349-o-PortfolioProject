# Tech Stack

## Application Design

I plan to use Figma for the design of the application. Figma provides a great interface for creating interactive prototypes, allowing me to refine the user experience before development. For the UI, I will be using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and ShadCN for accessible and reusable components. This combination ensures both a highly customizable and visually appealing design system.

## Front End Framework

I will use React for the front-end development. React's component-based structure allows me to build in a scalable way. Tailwind CSS will handle styling, while ShadCN will provide prebuilt UI components that align well with modern design principles. I will also use ESLint for maintaining code consistency and may include TypeScript for type safety (TBD).

## State Management

I will use React's useContext and Context API for state management. This provides a lightweight and efficient solution for managing global state without the complexity of Redux. The Context API is particularly useful for this project as it simplifies the state-sharing process across components while maintaining clear and manageable code.

## Node

I will use Node.js for the back-end development. Node.js provides a fast, scalable, and efficient runtime environment for building server-side applications.

## Express

I will use Express to handle the API layer. Express is a lightweight and flexible framework for building RESTful APIs. Its simplicity and rich ecosystem make it an excellent choice for rapid backend development.

## Database (MongoDB)

I plan to use MongoDB as the database solution for this project. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows for flexible, schema less data storage, making it an ideal choice for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. (A possible switch to postgres down the line)
